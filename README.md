ðŸ“Š Sentiment Analysis
A machine learning project that analyzes and classifies the sentiment of textual data into positive, negative, or neutral categories. This tool is useful for understanding customer feedback, analyzing reviews, and monitoring public opinion on social media.


ðŸ§  Overview
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the sentiment behind textual data. The model can be trained using public datasets like IMDB, Twitter, or custom datasets, and it supports both binary and multi-class sentiment classification.

âœ¨ Features
Preprocessing of raw text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Visualization of sentiment distribution

Train/test split and evaluation

Support for multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, RoBERTa)

Scalable pipeline for training and deployment

Optional web interface or REST API (if included)

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, NumPy

Optional: Transformers (Hugging Face), Flask/Streamlit (for deployment), Jupyter Notebooks

ðŸš€ Installation
Clone the repository


git clone https://github.com/HamzaKotbAddin/Sentiment_Analysis.git
cd Sentiment_Analysis
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt
ðŸ“Œ Usage
You can run the script using the command line or through a Jupyter notebook.


python main.py
Or open and explore:


jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
Modify the dataset path and model configurations inside config.py or directly in the script.

ðŸŽ¯ Model Training
Dataset: [Twitter]

Train/Test Split: 80/20

Model(s): [fine-tuned RoBERTa]

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score
Logistic Regression	87.3%	88.1%	86.2%	87.1%
RoBERTa	92.5%	92.8%	92.1%	92.4%

Add visualizations of the confusion matrix and word clouds in results/.
