ðŸ“Š Sentiment Analysis
A machine learning project that analyzes and classifies the sentiment of textual data into positive, negative, or neutral categories. This tool is useful for understanding customer feedback, analyzing reviews, and monitoring public opinion on social media.


ðŸ§  Overview
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the sentiment behind textual data. The model can be trained using public datasets like IMDB, Twitter, or custom datasets, and it supports both binary and multi-class sentiment classification.

âœ¨ Features
Preprocessing of raw text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Visualization of sentiment distribution

Train/test split and evaluation

Support for multiple classifiers

Scalable pipeline for training and deployment


ðŸ›  Tech Stack
